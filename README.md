## First Step: The Console

- The first part of this project is to write a **command interpreter** (also called a console) to manage the AirBnB objects.
- The console will allow to create, update, delete, and manipulate different types of objects, such as users, states, cities, places, etc.
- The console will also allow to store and retrieve these objects from a file using **JSON** serialization and deserialization.
